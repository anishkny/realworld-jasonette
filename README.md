**WIP!**

# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### [Jasonette](http://jasonette.com) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://www.jasonbase.com/things/xLMD/edit)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Jasonette** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Jasonette** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
